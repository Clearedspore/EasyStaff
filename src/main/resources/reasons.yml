# Offenses used by the /punish or /p command
# How to make a new reason?
# First lets get the reason we want I will use Discrimination
# Discrimination:
#
# Now lets get the first offence witch is a 7 day mute
# Discrimination:
#   1:
#     type: MUTE
#     duration: 7d
#
# For the second offense I want to use a custom reason and it will be a 14 day mute
# Discrimination:
#   1:
#     type: MUTE
#     duration: 7d
#   2:
#     type: MUTE
#     duration: 14d
#     reason: "Discrimination (second offense)"
#
# And that is how you make your own reason with offenses. Make sure to check the wiki for way more info.

# Want to use spaces in your reason? for example Advertising (scam) do it like this
# Advertising_scam:
#   1:
#     type: MUTE
#     duration: 7d
#     reason: "Advertising (scam)"
